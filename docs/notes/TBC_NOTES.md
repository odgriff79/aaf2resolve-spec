# TBC Notes (append-only)

- Validate random events in canonical JSON vs legacy CSV
- Ensure source chain resolves to original camera files (not proxies)
- Selective parameter extraction (tiny/default/expanded profiles)
- Keep option to include FrameFlex data later (not now)
- Add test AA Fs + matching legacy CSVs
- Prep FCPXML generation parity with Resolve; supply legacy generator + valid Resolve exports
- Legacy FCPXML generator has OOB keyframes — track fix
- Improve “new Claude chat” bootstrap via repo briefs (avoid long intros)
- Strict versioning + date stamps in code comments for continuity
- Consider web app to compress long chats into short briefs
- Agents via ADK to write/update notes automatically
- Preference: terminal-paste commands to reduce manual steps
- Keep last-chat “golden takeaways” without blowing context tokens
- Don’t over-share archives to avoid token burn; lean on repo refs
- Track “what worked where” (commit+file anchors in notes)
- Expand tests to additional fixtures
- Parameter inventory/values/compare tools for data-driven selection
- Create REQUIRED_FIELDS.md for current minimal capture; keep editable
