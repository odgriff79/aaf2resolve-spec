# AAF to Resolve FCPXML Converter

This project provides a robust, JSON-first pipeline to convert Avid AAF sequences into FCPXML 1.13 files for import into DaVinci Resolve, without relying on the proprietary Resolve API. The process consists of:

1. Parsing AAF files into a canonical, well-documented JSON schema.
2. Loading JSON into a normalized SQLite database (for analysis or migration).
3. Exporting FCPXML 1.13, suitable for import into DaVinci Resolve, from the canonical JSON format.

**Key Features:**
- Canonical, annotated JSON schema for interchange.
- Full SQLite relational schema for validation and transformation.
- FCPXML output adheres to key Resolve requirements (frame duration, timecode, asset mapping, etc.).
- No proprietary or closed-source dependencies (uses [pyaaf2](https://github.com/markreidvfx/pyaaf2)).

**Directory Structure:**
- `/docs`: Data model, database schema, FCPXML rules/specs.
- `/src`: CLI tools for AAF parsing, FCPXML writing, DB loading, and optional CSV extraction.
- `/tests`: Holds sample AAFs and expected outputs for validation.

See `/docs/project_brief.md` for the full design brief.

ðŸ“š Documentation Map

This repository is primarily a knowledge base for building reliable AAF â†’ Resolve FCPXML pipelines.
All rules and semantics are defined in /docs. The /src code is scaffolding that must follow these specifications.

Project Brief
 â€” goals, pain points, context

Canonical Data Model
 â€” single source of truth JSON schema

Database Schema
 â€” optional relational model for analysis

FCPXML Rules
 â€” Resolve 1.13 quirks & compliance rules

In-Memory Pipeline
 â€” architecture for direct parsing with pyaaf2

Inspector Rule Pack
 â€” traversal, UMID resolution, effect extraction

Legacy Compressed JSON Rules
 â€” proven method based on compressed JSON dumps of top-level CompositionMobs (kept for traceability; any approach that produces the same canonical structure is valid)

Backlog
 â€” future features and open tasks

ðŸ’¡ Key principle: Writers and downstream tools must always consume the canonical JSON defined in data_model_json.md.
The database and legacy compressed JSON paths are optional helpers, not required dependencies.
