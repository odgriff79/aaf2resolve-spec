# AAF to Resolve FCPXML Converter

This project provides a robust, JSON-first pipeline to convert Avid AAF sequences into FCPXML 1.13 files for import into DaVinci Resolve, without relying on the proprietary Resolve API. The process consists of:

1. Parsing AAF files into a canonical, well-documented JSON schema.
2. Loading JSON into a normalized SQLite database (for analysis or migration).
3. Exporting FCPXML 1.13, suitable for import into DaVinci Resolve, from the canonical JSON format.

**Key Features:**
- Canonical, annotated JSON schema for interchange.
- Full SQLite relational schema for validation and transformation.
- FCPXML output adheres to key Resolve requirements (frame duration, timecode, asset mapping, etc.).
- No proprietary or closed-source dependencies (uses [pyaaf2](https://github.com/markreidvfx/pyaaf2)).

**Directory Structure:**
- `/docs`: Data model, database schema, FCPXML rules/specs.
- `/src`: CLI tools for AAF parsing, FCPXML writing, DB loading, and optional CSV extraction.
- `/tests`: Holds sample AAFs and expected outputs for validation.

See `/docs/project_brief.md` for the full design brief.

üìñ Prerequisites & References

Anyone implementing or extending this project is expected to have full working knowledge of the following references:

Avid AAF SDK
The canonical reference for Avid‚Äôs Advanced Authoring Format (AAF).
Understanding of CompositionMob, SourceMob, OperationGroup, Descriptor, and Locator structures is mandatory.

pyaaf2 (Python binding for AAF2)
Referred to in Python as aaf2.
Documentation: https://pyaaf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

Used in this project for in-memory traversal of AAF structures.

AAFInspector (Lawson-Tanner repo)
https://github.com/lawson-tanner/AAFInspector/tree/main

Valuable for exploring and visualizing AAF internals. Many of our early rules were cross-checked against its dumps.

FCPXML Developer Documentation
https://fcp.cafe/developers/fcpxml/

Defines the official FCPXML 1.13 spec and quirks relevant for DaVinci Resolve.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note:
All traversal, resolution, and effect extraction logic in this repo assumes deep familiarity with the above sources. This repository does not duplicate them ‚Äî it builds rules, patterns, and canonical mappings on top of them.


üìö Documentation Map

This repository is primarily a knowledge base for building reliable AAF ‚Üí Resolve FCPXML pipelines.
All rules and semantics are defined in /docs. The /src code is scaffolding that must follow these specifications.

Project Brief
 ‚Äî goals, pain points, context

Canonical Data Model
 ‚Äî single source of truth JSON schema

Database Schema
 ‚Äî optional relational model for analysis

FCPXML Rules
 ‚Äî Resolve 1.13 quirks & compliance rules

In-Memory Pipeline
 ‚Äî architecture for direct parsing with pyaaf2

Inspector Rule Pack
 ‚Äî traversal, UMID resolution, effect extraction

Legacy Compressed JSON Rules
 ‚Äî proven method based on compressed JSON dumps of top-level CompositionMobs (kept for traceability; any approach that produces the same canonical structure is valid)

Backlog
 ‚Äî future features and open tasks

üí° Key principle: Writers and downstream tools must always consume the canonical JSON defined in data_model_json.md.
The database and legacy compressed JSON paths are optional helpers, not required dependencies.
