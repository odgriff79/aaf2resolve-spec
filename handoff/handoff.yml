      COMPLETED: Added validate_event_ids() function with proper regex pattern validation.
      COMPLETED: Integrated into _run_additional_validations() function.
      COMPLETED: Added import re statement.
      READY: Function validates ev_NNNN pattern per docs/data_model_json.md spec.
      GPT should now test against tests/samples/*.json files and generate validation report.
