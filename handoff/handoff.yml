      COMPLETED: Full AAF → canonical JSON implementation with UMID chain resolution,
      complete OperationGroup capture, path fidelity, logging, event ID generation.
      TESTED: Core structure validated.

    handoff_notes: |
      COMPLETED: Full FCPXML 1.13 writer implementation per docs/fcpxml_rules.md.
      - Frame-to-time conversion for NTSC rates
      - Asset declaration and deduplication
      - Conservative effect mapping
      - Proper sequence/spine structure
      NEEDS: Integration testing with canonical JSON samples.

spec_compliance:
  - "docs/fcpxml_rules.md - FCPXML 1.13 output specification"
  - "docs/data_model_json.md - canonical JSON input contract"
  - "docs/collaboration_protocol.md - file header metadata requirements"

outputs_expected:
  - "Integration tests: canonical JSON → FCPXML → validation"
  - "End-to-end pipeline testing with test samples"
  - "Round-trip validation reports"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "Pipeline works: AAF → canonical JSON → FCPXML"
  - "FCPXML validates against Resolve import requirements"
  - "All file headers include proper metadata per collaboration_protocol.md"
  - "Test coverage for integration scenarios"

next_action: |
  GEMINI: Create integration tests for the complete pipeline:
  
  1. Test canonical JSON → FCPXML conversion with tests/samples/*.json
  2. Validate FCPXML structure and Resolve compatibility
  3. Create end-to-end pipeline test with mock AAF data
  4. Generate validation reports in /reports/integration/
  5. Ensure all files have proper header metadata per docs/collaboration_protocol.md
  6. Update handoff → owner: "COPILOT", status: "needs_review" for final PR and architecture review
